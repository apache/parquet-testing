# Variant Binary Encoding

This directory contains binary artifacts encoded using the Parquet [Variant]
binary encoding. These files are **not** valid Parquet files, but rather
raw binary data. 

## Structure

* `data_dictionary.json` - contains the JSON representation for each example

Each example consists of 2 files:

* `.metadata` -- the binary contents of the `metadata` field
* `.value` -- the binary contents of the `value` field

## Descriptions

1. `primitive_<type>` -- Examples primitive (`basic_type` = 1), one for each of the [primitive types listed in the spec]
2. `short_string` -- Example of short string (`basic_type` = 2)
3. `object_empty` -- Example of object (`basic_type` = 3) with no fields
3. `object_primitive` -- Example of object with only primitive fields
4. `object_nested` -- Example of object with other objects in fields 
5. `array_empty` -- Example of array (`basic_type` = 4) with no elements
5. `array_primitive` -- Example of array with only primitive elements
6. `array_nested` -- Example of an with objects and other arrays in the elements

## Regenerating these files

The files were generated by running the [`regen.py`](regen.py) script that uses Apache Spark to 
generate the files.
