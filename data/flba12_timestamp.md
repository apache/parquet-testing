# `flba12_timestamp.parquet`

Three columns with physical type `FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY(12)` and logical type `TIMESTAMP`.

## Schema

```
message flba12_timestamp {
  optional fixed_len_byte_array(12) timestamp_millis (TIMESTAMP(MILLIS,true));
  optional fixed_len_byte_array(12) timestamp_micros (TIMESTAMP(MICROS,true));
  optional fixed_len_byte_array(12) timestamp_nanos  (TIMESTAMP(NANOS,true));
}
```

All columns use `TYPE_DEFINED_ORDER`. For the `timestamp_nanos` column, two out of the six rows
require more than 64 bits to represent.

## Values

The same six timestamp values appear in every column, only the unit scale differs.

| Row | Instant (UTC)             | Note                                        |
|-----|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 0   | 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z      | Epoch — all-zero bytes                      |
| 1   | 1970-01-01T00:00:01Z      | Small positive                              |
| 2   | 1969-12-31T23:59:59Z      | Small negative — exercises two's-complement |
| 3   | 2262-04-11T23:47:16Z      | Near INT64-nanos max (epochSecond = 9 223 372 036) |
| 4   | 9999-12-31T23:59:59Z      | Far future — NANOS exceeds INT64            |
| 5   | 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z      | Far past — NANOS is below INT64 minimum     |
